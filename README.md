Tutorial App for [Optimizely Remote Config Tutorial for iOS](www.optimizely.com)

If you’ve ever thought, “if only I could just send an instant update to my deployed iOS app!” you wouldn’t be alone. Who wouldn’t want the ability to quickly squash a bug in their deployed iOS app, or remotely tweak the behavior of their app in response to user feedback? 

To quickly learn how to get started using Optimizely to power fast, reliable (and [free](https://www.optimizely.com/rollouts-signup/ios/?utm_campaign=feature-flags-swift)!) remote configuration on iOS, follow the detailed how-to guide: [Optimizely Remote Config Tutorial for iOS](www.optimizely.com), and use this completed tutorial app or the app at the commit specific zip file (linked in steps in the how-to guide) necessary to complete that step. 

##Scenario
Imagine we are an indie game developer team building iOS games with Apple’s [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/) framework. We go by the team name “Game Wizards” 🧙‍♂️🧙‍♀️, because our apps just have that special magic 💫!  We’re thrilled because our most recent app “Tappy Bird” suddenly went viral last week. But the cost of our success means that we are already starting to get requests from users on social media and the App Store to change the way the game works. 

##What You'll Learn
In this tutorial you’ll learn how to remotely change variables in your deployed iOS app, enabling you to quickly change the behavior of your app, or the variables of your features without needing to wait for an app store review or resubmission process!

##Getting Started
With Optimizely’s [free](https://www.optimizely.com/rollouts-signup/ios/?utm_campaign=feature-flags-swift) & open source [SDKs](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/sdk-reference-guides) for iOS and Android, you can customize the rate at which your mobile app polls the Optimizely API for new variable configurations (and feature rollouts) and rest assured that your app won’t be delayed waiting on a network call to return the remote configuration values, because they’re stored locally on the SDK client. And with local & deterministic user bucketing, you can confidently deliver different configurations to different users/filters across implementation contexts.

Follow the detailed how-to guide: [Optimizely Remote Config Tutorial for iOS](www.optimizely.com), for steps on running the tutorial app.
